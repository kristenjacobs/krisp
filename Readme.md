# krisp

A really simple LISP.

## TODO

- Add 'env' builtin to dump the global + local environment. 
- Add implementation of 'partial' to the library.
- Move the builtin functions (such as +, -, etc) to the env, so they can be passed as args.
- Implement (+ test) library functions to map/reduce/filter over lists.
- Implement the logical operators + suuport boolean types.
- Extend first/rest/conj/cons to work on strings.
- Implement concat for lists and strings in the library.
