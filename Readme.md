# krisp

A really simple LISP.

## TODO

- Split the gobal and local namespaces.
- Test recursion (looping) works as expected.
- Implement if.
- Cast to 'number' instead of just int, i.e. accept floats.
- Support functions as first class, i.e. passing, returning and lambdas (+ closures).
* Add support for builtin 'list' function to create a list (i.e. quote)
- Add support for builtin 'first' function, to get the head of a list.
- Add support for builtin 'next' function, to get the tail of a list.
- Add support for builtin 'conj' function, to add an element to the head of a list.
- Add library function to map over list.
- Add library function to reduce over lists.
